\section{Appendix C: Machine Specifications}

To give a historically situated reader an idea of the difficulty (or triviality) of the computations that I performed, I will provide some basic specs on the two machines that I used:
\begin{itemize}
\item{13" Mid 2012 MacBook Air - 4GB RAM, 1.8GHz Intel Core i5, with a quick ping SSD}
\item{27" Retina 5K iMac - 24GB RAM, 4.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, with a very slow ping Network based File System}
\end{itemize}
