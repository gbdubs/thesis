\section{Reconstruction Conjecture}

The \emph{Reconstruction Conjecture} is an open conjecture in theoretical computer science which proposes a relationship between subgraph isomorphisms and graph isomorphism.
Specifically, the conjecture revolves around the idea of a \emph{deck} of a graph G: a multiset of graphs which are the vertex deleted subgraphs of the graph.
Two decks are isomorphic if their graph constituents can be matched up on a one to one basis such that each pair of deck \emph{cards} is isomorphic.
The conjecture claims that if two graphs G and H have isomorphic decks, then they are isomorphic.
