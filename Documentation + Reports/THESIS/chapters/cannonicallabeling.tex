\chapter{Canonical Labeling Using Cycles}


\section{Background}
A canonical labeling of a graph is a labeling of edges in a way that is consistent across all isomorphic graph instances of the same graph.
Given two graphs and their canonical labelings, graph isomorphism is then a simple quadratic-time check to make sure that alike-labeled vertices preserve all adjacencies and non-adjacencies. 
Thus, any canonical labeling algorithm is in $GI$, the time complexity class of the graph isomorphism problem.

Many parts of my coding projects required the use of a canonical labeler.
Sometimes this was because I wanted to check for isomorphisms on a broad set of graphs, a problem that is possible to complete quickly given the lexicographical nature of canonical labels.
Though there exist good algorithms for determining canonical labeling, I wanted to create my own, both as an exercise in implementation, and in algorithm design.
The result of this process is an algorithm which is relatively slow, but whose time growth is small relative to faster algorithms.

\section{Augmented Paths}

\section{A Consistent Algorithm}
The algorithm has a simple interpretation. 
It divides all of the vertices of the graphs into disjoint (covering) sets based on the value of the cycles vertex invariant.
For each of these sets with more than one vertex, a second round of `augmented paths' is performed to further divide sets, if possible.
It sorts each of these classes by its size, then by its paths values.
Each of these sorts is performed in a consistent way, which is irrespective of the original labeling of the graph.

Once the order of the sets is sorted, we consider every possible permutation of the values within each of the sets so that every possible ordering of vertexes is possible, with the constraint that each set element remains in the higher level order established by the sets themselves.
We traverse through these permutations and select the matrix which is lexicographically the `smallest'.
A clever optimization allows us to not generate any permutations which are automatically `larger' than the thus far `smallest' matrix.

I wrote and optimized the algorithm for Matlab (as that is the slowest of my use cases), but then worked on implementing it in C and Javascript.
All three versions of this code are available in my online repository documenting my thesis work.
The Matlab code provides detailed explanations of each piece of the code, why I implemented it that way, and the thoughts that went into it.

\section{Time Growth Comparisons to Faster Algorithms}
Any discussion of a homegrown algorithm would be either incomplete or intentionally salacious without a discussion of how it compares to out of the box algorithms.
For these benchmarks, I established two datasets, one of 10000 randomly generated graphs of size ten to fifty using an Erdos-Renyi model, and one using a graph model which is more likely to produce highly automorphic graphs (discussed in detail in chapter 6).
For both of these models we used a probability of $p=0.5$, as these are typically the graphs that are hardest to discriminate against.

To give perspective to my own time results, I used an established and well optimized piece of code, the canonical labeler from the NAUTY package.
A summary of the results is shown below, alongside equations which estimate their overall running time with the above parameters.
From these figures it is clear that the NAUTY package outperforms my canonical labeler, but that my labeler appears to have a lower growth rate.
I would imagine that this difference can be attributed to the large lengths my labeler goes to to minimize the number of permutations that are checked.
NAUTY's algorithm uses simpler heuristics (such as X and X) to eliminate permutations, while mine uses significantly more power to make likely better informed choices.
