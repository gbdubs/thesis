\chapter*{Introduction}

When I asked Professor Storer to supervise me on a thesis on the graph isomorphism problem, he was hesitant.
He only acquiesced when I persuaded him that my future was secure with a fantastic job, and that my primary objective was the pursuit (and possible re-discovery) of questions that were of nothing but personal interest to me.
In many respects, his skepticism proved well founded.

This work has been incredibly challenging, both in that the body of existing work on GI is so large, and in that few niches of it exist which are promising and not yet fully explored.
Over the past year I have poured my time and energy into this project, and have found it unbelievably energizing to do so.
I have been thrilled to find interesting properties in problems surrounding GI, and have had an equal number of frustrations in finding that my results had been previously discovered.
Moreover, it has been illuminating to begin to understand a hidden world of graph theory which had before seemed either trivial or intractably complex.

I would like to thank Professor Storer for the initial bout of skepticism about this project, as it shaped this project and experience for the better.
But I would also like to thank him for the amount of advice and freedom that he has supported me with on this project.
It has kept me on track to focus on my real goal for the semester, which was to learn and grow.
I have learned advanced techniques in GPU calculation, proof techniques in abstract algebra, and forced me to think about established problems in new and interesting ways.
My skill set has been broadened by this project which has deeply challenged me and always kept me on my toes.

I would like to thank my advisors, the department, and my friends and family for all of the different kinds of support and encouragement that have brought me to successful completion of this project.
