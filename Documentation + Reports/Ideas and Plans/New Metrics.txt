new properties
- N Triangles
- Girth - smallest cycle
- Wiener Index --> sum of lengths of shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph (connected only)
- Algebraic Connectivity : The algebraic connectivity of a graph G is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of G
- Strength of a Graph - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_a_graph
- Average Eccentricty of a graph (longest path from a node to any other)
- Radius = minimum eccentricity

possible properties
- Between Centrality : number of shortest paths from all vertices to all others that pass through that node

- chromatic number

- Cheeger Constant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeger_constant_(graph_theory)

- Clique number (size of largest clique)
- K edge connected (i.e. you can remove K edges and it will still be connected)
- Book thickness (all can be done in a book, how many pages you need?) (NP HARD!)
- Hosoya Index (Looks tricky...)
